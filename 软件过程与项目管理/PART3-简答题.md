| customer  | scrum **keeps customer informed** about every step<br />during project development | Waterfall **only contacts** customer<br />**at the dilivery date** |
| changes   | scrum welcomes changes of requirements at **early and late**<br />stages of the project | Waterfall welcomes changes only at <br />requirement phase and making changes<br />is not allowed at late stage |
